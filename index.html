		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Well folks, this is a wild one. I recently wrote about a <a href="https://jmanes.blog/2023/12/30/roccat-kone-air.html">Roccat Kone Air</a> mouse that I purchased for use exclusively with macOS. For a short while it worked great, but then the plan quickly fell apart.</p>
<h2>Where are my profiles?</h2>
<p>In my original blog post, I wrote about how the on-board profiles for the mouse had to be configured using Windows software; specifically, Roccat‚Äôs Swarm software. However, since the profiles are on-board, that implies that they are portable to different operating systems. To configure my mouse, I opened Roccat Swarm on a Parallels virtual machine of Windows 11 and began tweaking. After closing the virtual machine, all of my custom profiles worked on macOS as I expected‚Ä¶ that is, until I unplugged the 2.4Ghz USB receiver.</p>
<p><img title="UntitledImage.png" src="https://j.manes.blog/uploads/2024/untitledimage.png" alt="A screenshot of the Roccat Swarm software running on my Windows 11 virtual machine through Parallels. The various custom profiles and button mappings are visible." width="599" height="461" border="0" /></p>
<p>It turns out, the USB receiver needs a special sauce that only the Roccat Swarm software can provide. Re-launching Roccat Swarm from the Windows 11 virtual machine and then closing the virtual machine fixes the issue, but this solution sucks. I don‚Äôt want to do this every time I dock my Mac. Even worse, I use this same dock for my separate work-provisioned Mac. This means the profiles and their custom button mappings simply are not useful for my work environment. At this point I considered giving up and switching to a different mouse. However‚Ä¶ I am not sane, and I <em>really</em> like this mouse.</p>
<h2>How does Roccat Swarm do it?</h2>
<p>I got to thinking about how this whole thing works. I plug in the USB receiver‚Ä¶ I launch Roccat Swarm‚Ä¶ and it works. Even between operating systems (as long as the receiver is never unplugged), as proven by my Windows 11 virtual machine workflow. So maybe Roccat Swarm isn‚Äôt actually required. Maybe‚Ä¶ Roccat Swarm sends some type of system call, wake up packet, etc to the USB receiver. On this hunch I started digging.</p>
<h2>Wireshark magic</h2>
<p>I hang out in a Discord with a few ethical hacker type folks and when I brought this problem up, one of them recommended I use Wireshark to capture and dump the USB HID calls made by Roccat Swarm. This sounded like a good starting point. I had no idea Wireshark could even be used for USB devices, but I was willing to try anything. As a bonus, listening in on these calls is a clean-house reverse engineering approach to the problem.</p>
<p>After a bit of research I fired up Wireshark on an old dedicated Windows machine using the <a href="https://desowin.org/usbpcap/">USBPcap</a> plugin. I then attached the USB 2.4Ghz receiver to the Windows machine and opened Roccat Swarm. Wouldn‚Äôt you know it, it worked like a charm!</p>
<p><img title="UntitledImage.png" src="https://j.manes.blog/uploads/2024/3867d9537a.png" alt="A screenshot of Wireshark showing a partial capture of USB calls as made by Roccat Swarm" width="599" height="506" border="0" /></p>
<p>Ok‚Ä¶ so there is a lot here. I don‚Äôt know the first thing about USB HID specifications or how it fits together (or at least, I didn‚Äôt when I started). I did notice however a distinct set of calls for ‚ÄúSET_REPORT‚Äù, each call with a respective data payload. So now I know what Roccat Swarm is sending to the device on startup, and I have the exact data it sends over. Awesome.</p>
<h2>Time to learn a new programming language‚Ä¶ yes really</h2>
<p>I have never programmed for macOS or iOS before, but I knew I was going to have to start. After a few failed attempts to use libusb with Python (Apple has locked out this approach, that‚Äôs a rant for a different time), I decided to look into Objective-C and Swift‚Ä¶ but mostly Swift in order to preserve my sanity.</p>
<p>After digging for only a few hours I found an awesome library called <a href="https://github.com/Arti3DPlayer/USBDeviceSwift/tree/master">USBDeviceSwift</a> that abstracts away a lot of nitty gritty details of USB / HID interactions. I pulled this into my project using Swift‚Äôs package manager (wild times we live in) and started learning and implementing. This involved reading the USB dump from Wireshark and translating the required segments for SET_REPORT into Swift model objects in my project.</p>
<h2>Success and Thoughts</h2>
<p>After a few days of tinkering during my spare time I finally got what I was after. I now have a simple command line tool that invokes a list of SET_REPORT calls to the Roccat Kone Air USB receiver. Running this program successfully activates the on-board profiles and their respective button mappings on macOS.¬†</p>
<p><img title="UntitledImage.png" src="https://j.manes.blog/uploads/2024/737b480229.png" alt="A screenshot of the Terminal application on macOS invoking my custom program." width="599" height="415" border="0" /></p>
<p>Curiously, doing a single SET_REPORT for any of these inputs is enough to do the job‚Ä¶ so I am not sure what that is about. I simply chose to do them all, as that is what the Roccat Swarm software does. Honestly? Totally worth the effort. I‚Äôm not exactly sure why this is necessary‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôm not sure why Roccat engineered the device to require these calls for on-board profile activation, but at least I have it working.</p>
<p>As an aside, I wanted to try implementing this with DriverKit, but Apple wanted me to pay $100/yr for the privilege. I‚Äôll stick with my command line program and a login script.¬†</p>

			 <p>With a little thinking, I was able to get the <a href="https://www.roccat.com/products/kone-air?variant=42180133093534">Roccat Kone Air</a> mouse to behave as a good macOS citizen. I chose to buy this mouse due to its usage of AA batteries, somewhat muted design, and ergonomics. Configuration did require me to fire up a Parellels Windows 11 VM and install the Roccat software, but after a one-time setup, it is good to go. This is largely doable thanks to the ‚ÄúEasy-Shift[+]‚Äù modifier button near the thumb rest in combination with the on-board profile system.</p>
<p>Here are the mappings I chose in the Roccat software:<br /><br />[Easy-Shift-Button + Left Click] maps to [CTRL + Left Arrow Key]</p>
<pre>Moves one desktop to the left</pre>
<p>[Easy-Shift-Button + Right Click] maps to [CTRL + Right Arrow Key]</p>
<pre>Moves one desktop to the right</pre>
<p>[Easy-Shift-Button + Middle Click] maps to [CTRL + Up Arrow Key]</p>
<pre>Mission Control</pre>
<p>[Easy-Shift-Button + Scroll Up] maps to [Tilt Right]</p>
<pre>Scrolls right</pre>
<p>[Easy-Shift-Button + Scroll Down] maps to [Tilt Left]</p>
<pre>Scrolls left</pre>
<p>For the forward and backward thumb buttons, I used a piece of software called <a href="https://better-mouse.com">BetterMouse</a> on macOS to map them to forward and backward swipe respectively.</p>

			 <p>I have become endlessly frustrated with the lack of good mice options for the Mac. Most options are immediately off the table due to a requirement on Windows-only drivers and adware. The options that do exist for Mac have a ton of problems.</p>
<p>For example, some of my favorite choices are the Logitech MX Master / MX Vertical mice, but they have this terrible problem with deteriorating after a few years. The rubber coating decays so quickly and ends up feeling sticky. That is not okay for a $100.00 product. Logitech mice also require the use of their ‚ÄúLogiOptions‚Äù application, which requests a ton of system permissions on install. Permission to start on log-in, permission to monitor input from your keyboard (!?).. this is not sane. What has happened to sane perhipheral products?</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>It was a special day today.</p>
<p>I went into the Acura dealer to take a look at the Integra Type S. I had been interested in it for a while now, but it was nothing more than a passing interest. However, after talking with a few of the sales reps, they gave me a deal I could not refuse. They offered me the MSRP sale price of my 2019 Civic Type R as trade in value. In other words, they offered me a trade in credit equal to what I paid for the car brand new in 2019. ü§Ø I took the deal and quickly got into a gorgeous ‚Äúplatinum white pearl‚Äù Type S.</p>
<p>This is not a typical ‚Äúday in the life‚Äù type of event for me (clearly), but it<em> is</em> something I must write about. I‚Äôll miss my Civic Type R; that car did a lot for me. It was a purchase of passion that followed my renewed interest in the automotive field. This interest pulled me out of a sadness that had followed me for years prior. It‚Äôs hard to explain, and it sounds very silly and materialistic. It wasn‚Äôt the car itself that put me into a better place, thankfully I can take the credit for that. The Type R did, however, symbolicly represent that special moment in my life where I felt a new passion for the first time in years. It represents the bloom of my 20s, even if that bloom came quite late (27).¬†</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt have many new photos of my new Type S as of writing, as it was pouring rain today. Fitting for a bitter sweet day; the beginning of fall in the USA. There will be more photos to come once the weather improves, but for now here are a few from my garage.</p>

			 <p>A strict exercise and diet routine no longer works for me as it did just a few years ago. I am not sure what changed, outside of aging, but it is really frustrating. Somewhat recently, I tried intaking around 1400 KCal / day (on average per-week) along with low-sugar intake and my weight barely budged even after a few months. I really don‚Äôt think I can go lower than this, so off to the doctor I go! Hopefully I can get a metabolic study done, or at least get my thyroid looked at. Thankfully my weight has not ballooned, but I should be about 30 pounds (13.5 kg) lighter than I am today.</p>

		<a href="https://j.manes.blog/2023/09/02/where-dyson-fans.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-09-02 20:23:38 -0600">Sep 2, 2023</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>For many years now, I have used Dyson products: two <em>Pure Hot+Cool HP04</em>, one <em>Pure Humidify+Cool PH01</em> and a few of their vacuums. When it comes to the vacuums, I couldn‚Äôt be happier with the performance and experience provided. As for the humidfier and heaters, though‚Ä¶ it is complicated.</p>
<p><img title="IMG_5476.png" src="https://j.manes.blog/uploads/2023/img-5476.png" alt="My nickle/black Dyson Pure Hot+Cool HP04 next to my office wall." width="450" height="600" border="0" /></p>
<p>Originally, I purchased a pair of Pure Hot+Cool HP04 heaters for the winter time. I keep one in my bedroom and one in my office where my pet guinea pigs live. I made a quick assumption during my purchase that you ‚Äúget what you pay for.‚Äù Dyson‚Äôs products are attractive and expensive, so I figured they would offer the highest performance. As it turns out, in this case, it isn‚Äôt true.</p>
<h2>These devices are noisey as hell.</h2>
<p>My first and chief complaint about these devices: they all suffer from build quality defects that lead to noise pollution. I don‚Äôt use that term lightly. It is seriously unbearable at times, to the point that I *must* turn the device off for my own sanity. Typically, the issue happens at the lowest speeds. There is some sort of fan oscillation going on that leads to the highest pitch squeeling imagineable. This happens with three of my Dyson fans; this is no fluke. When the fan is set to run above level 4 (out of 10) the squeeling will subside. Still, not ideal. Nearly a deal breaker for the product as a whole, in fact.</p>
<h2>These devices are not good for air filtration.</h2>
<p>My second complaint is that the air filtration offered by these machines is horrifically poor. The CADR (clean air delivery rate) rating is laughably low, and cheaper products exist that do the job far better. In fact, strapping MERV 8 rated HVAC filter on to a box fan does a better job. No, I‚Äôm not kidding. Check out this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uZKBlwLEFs">CBC News video</a> for details on that one.</p>
<p>Not only is the filtration unbearably slow, the filters within the unit cost around $80 to replace as of writing (2023), and they only last about one year before the Dyson app warns about ordering a replacement. In contrast, BlueAir offers a 211+ auto model with a filter that lasts WAY longer with over 4x the CADR. The replacement filter for the BlueAir? It is only $50. As of the time of writing, the BlueAir machine costs a whopping $250 less than what I paid for my Dyson, and it costs less in filter replacements, too. All of this is why my dining room / kitchen area is proudly accompanied by a BlueAir 211+ Auto.</p>
<h2>The humidfier takes a long time to humidify.</h2>
<p>My final complaint (whew, as if I could be any more negative) is that the <em>Pure Humidify+Cool PH01</em> takes what feels like forever to humidfy a room of any size. I believe this problem is very much aligned with the CADR problem. These fans simply do not move a lot of air, and that is by design. They are very nice to use as a personal fan, as they are (supposed to be) quiet and focused.</p>
<p>However, the <em>Pure Humidify+Cool PH01</em> has a benefit I haven‚Äôt seen in other humidifiers in that it actually cleans the water before it puts it out into the room. It does this with UV light, which rocks, because typical humidfiers you see on Amazon are utter garbage in this respect. Don‚Äôt believe me? Buy a random Amazon humidifier and let it run while it sits next to a smart air filter such as a Dyson or BlueAir. Your air filters will fight for their lives trying to pull the gunk out of the air. With the Dyson PH01, no problems, the air is clean.</p>
<h2>Somehow, these devices are still better than the alternative.</h2>
<p>Now here is where things get complicated. These machines all perform a very specific subset of features that you will not find elsewhere. After getting fed up with the compromises, I started looking for alternatives only to find myself at an impasse. I wanted the best possible result in each of the respective areas (do one thing and do it well).</p>
<p>If I wanted the best possible air filtration system, I could get a BlueAir for my bedroom and for my office. However, these are not heaters. Because of this, I‚Äôd also need to buy a set of heaters, and as it turns out, really good space heaters cost really good money. For example, De‚ÄôLonghi offers a very nice oil-filled radiator style heater for around $170. Ouch! But wait‚Ä¶ the BlueAir filter is not a heater, and it is also not a fan. So now a pair of high-quality fans are required. At this point, I‚Äôm up to a total of six devices (three for each room) to replace the two Dyson machines that I have. That means three total electrical outlets instead of one, and three times the space (which I do not have). The total cost of these machines added together would be in the same ballpark range as a Dyson. Whoops! No money saving to be found here (this wasn‚Äôt the goal, but it would have been nice).</p>
<p>All of what I have touched on so far doesn‚Äôt address the problem of finding a good humidifier that outputs clean air (good luck with that shit, I tried). The integrated IoT (internet-of-things) capability was also not accounted for in my quest for the best, though you likely won‚Äôt find anything that works together as seemlessly as Dyson.</p>
<p>I guess this is essentially where Dyson has the market. It‚Äôs a bit strange, but this is a case where the market leader is a jack of all trades, and master of none: It‚Äôs not the best fan, it‚Äôs not the best heater (or humidifier), and it‚Äôs not the best air filter‚Ä¶ but it does all three of these things while using very little space, and for a competitive price.</p>
<p>For now, I‚Äôll be coughing up $80 for an air filter.</p>

			 <p>I recently let my Discord Nitro subscription expire, and this is a tough one for me. I use Discord quite often, but find paying for it very hard to justify due to its privacy policy and investment structure. It has become a rather ubiquitous tool in recent years, which makes me wonder if it is going to result in yet another Twitter fiasco.</p>
<p>Generally, I am ok with paying (and donating) for software services. They have to meet some level criteria for me to feel comfortable, though. For example, if the software and/or service is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open Source / Open Platform</li>
<ul>
<li>Lemmy (and selective instances)</li>
<li>Mastodon (and selective instances)</li>
</ul>
<li>Proprietary and/or Centralized, but operated in good faith, with a history and face</li>
<ul>
<li>Kagi</li>
<li>MarsEdit</li>
<li>Micro.blog</li>
<li>Ivory</li>
</ul>
<li>Privacy respecting by design, with mixed open source / proprietary status</li>
<ul>
<li>1Password</li>
<li>Proton Mail</li>
<li>iCloud (select services with advanced security enabled)</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>Discord is a prime example of something that does not quite fit into any of these categories. Discord does not respect privacy. Discord is not Open Source. Discord is not decentralized. Instead, it is held up by a combination of paid users and investors. This is enough to chase me away. I‚Äôm waiting for the inevitable sale of the platform and its data to a big tech conglomerate. The other shoe has yet to drop. Let‚Äôs just hope it isn‚Äôt placed into the hands of another Elon Musk.¬†</p>

			 <p>I seem to bounce back-and-forth between keeping social media in a browser via tab groups versus accessing them through dedicated apps. Dedicated apps offer a higher level of comfort for interaction, but I think that comfort comes with a time cost (i.e., routinely checking the various apps).

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I‚Äôve been thinking a little about how Meta‚Äôa Threads social network operates; specifically the algorithmic-first feed.¬†</p>
<p>The algorithmic-first feed is no blunder, it was done intentionally and it was very smart. Is it appealing to most of us who care about this kind of thing? Absolutely not. However, it is appealing to two specific groups that are absolutely required for a behemoth like Meta to bootstatrap themselves for an adjacent market sector: celebrities and brands.¬†</p>
<p>An algorithmic feed turns a ghost town into a brand new mall. It‚Äôs a place where things are obviously happening. This serves a few purposes that ultimately cascade.¬†</p>
<ol>
<li>It offers celebrities a platform where they know they will be seen before others, which is good for them.</li>
<li>It offers brands a platform where they will have a better presence, which is good for them.</li>
<li>The combination of 1 and 2 provde an entertainment-like experience of infinite content for users, which probably isn‚Äôt good for them, but they will consume it and complete the cycle.</li>
</ol>
<p>The third point about infinite algorithmic content is likely where folks will start questioning my reasoning. Who wants to get on a ‚Äúsocial network‚Äù just to browse around and view random garbage? As it turns out, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2022/03/16/5-facts-about-twitter-lurkers/">a lot of people</a>. How many hours do people spend mindlessly scrolling TikTok videos made by people they don‚Äôt know? I‚Äôm going to guess most of them.</p>
<p>Instagram has slowly been adopting the algorithmic-first feed over the past couple of years and it seems to be working for them. Why <em>wouldn‚Äôt</em> Threads also continue down this path? After all, adding a personal feed based on who you follow is the easy part. This functionality could be trivially added by Meta in the future if enough people are interested‚Ä¶ but will they be?</p>

			 <p>I have been exploring the Fediverse in all of its forms over the past few days. Lemmy instances, Mastodon instances, and the various administrators involved in it all. It is the wild west right now, but in a way that is optimistic and excting.</p>
<p>I've been thinking about how my blog here on MB fits into the equation, and I think MB serves as a more meaningful "home base." The content I share here is a bit more than a fleeting thought (unlike Mastodon) and it isn't specifically to spark conversation (unlike Lemmy). I think the strength of MB, right now, is that it offers the full-on ‚ÄúWeb 1.0‚Äù (I am stating this affectionately) blogging experience with the ability to tunnel blogged content to/from the Fediverse.¬†</p>

			 <p>It is unfortunate to hear about the Titan submersible implosion. I am unsure as to why anyone would have boarded that contraption given all of the information around it. I suppose they were mislead or perhaps threw caution to the wind. Given the Navy‚Äôs account regarding their detected implosion acoustic signature, the submersible simply descended into its own demise hours after departure.</p>
<p>It really reminds me of Mt. Everest, and the folks who spend thousands upon thousands of dollars to climb it and inevitably die a terrible death. I do not understand the desire to do these things, and I don‚Äôt think I ever will.</p>

			 <p>I am yet again refining my home network! This project involved running CAT6e cable to my entertainment system area. It went rather smoothly, despite requiring me to install a new wall gang and outlet for the ethernet port.</p>
<p><img title="camphoto_684387517.jpeg" src="https://j.manes.blog/uploads/2023/42294e4396.jpeg" alt="Photo of a newly installed wall gang, cables thrown about and some wall damage from the work done." width="450" height="600" border="0" /></p>
<p>The final result is prettier, though I did not end up painting over the patched drywall because I am lazy. That is future James‚Äô problem once it is actually visible to guests, rather than being hidden behind a media center.</p>
<p><img title="IMG_5116.png" src="https://j.manes.blog/uploads/2023/51afbde0b4.png" alt="Photo of the installed ethernet face plate while in use. Area cleaned up. Looking good!" width="600" height="450" border="0" /></p>
<p>The line runs from a managed 2.5gbe switch near the firewall. From this port, it hooks into an unmanaged 2.5gbe switch that then feeds the PlayStation 5, Sony TV and Intel NUC media PC. Loading media is instantaneous and the response feel is WAY better than before. Best of all this frees up airtime for the access points, so the entire network technically benefits from this change.</p>

			 <p>Have you noticed how many features added to macOS over the years are simply ‚Äúbolted-on?‚Äù It is perplexing how some of these features not complete, and yet, they persist.</p>
<p>Launchpad is a good example of this. It is essentially a bolt-on UI abstraction of the Applications folder that allows users to access and organize apps like one would on an iPhone. UI abstractions are fine if they are feature complete, but Launchpad is not feature complete.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs look at a common workflow within macOS; uninstalling an app. I‚Äôll drag Firefox from launchpad to the trash on the dock. What would a user expect to happen here? Classically, dragging an application from the Applications folder to the trash would work as expected. This is the uninstall workflow for applications on macOS and has been for over 20 years. So what happens when this is done via Launchpad?</p>
<p><img src="uploads/2023/4686c486fa.png" alt="" width="600" height="405" /></p>
<p>Nothing. Firefox moves back to where it was in the Launchpad grid and no action is taken. Huh??? Well, let‚Äôs try another app. Let‚Äôs drag Mona to the trash and see what happens.</p>
<p><img src="uploads/2023/5fabebe071.png" alt="" width="600" height="240" /></p>
<p>The application awkwardly transitions back to where it was in the Launchpad grid‚Ä¶ <em>but wait</em>! Now we are presented with a strange, poorly presented popup asking if the application should be uninstalled. Why did the application not simply move into the trash? Why is Mona being presented with an uninstall dialog, where as for Firefox nothing happened at all?</p>
<p>As it turns out, Launchpad can only uninstall applications that were originally installed via the App Store. Not in the OS standard way, though. Instead it leverages a brand new popup dialog. Why?</p>
<p>Both apps from this example, Mona and Firefox, can be uninstalled via drag-and-drop from the Applications folder to the trash. Only in Launchpad does this weird behavioral difference exist.</p>
<p>Launchpad‚Äôs bolt-on status goes beyond its bolt-on look and feel. It violates macOS UX ‚Äì this is not the way this OS was designed to be used. It is functionally broken. It is not a joy to use. I think it is fair to say that Launchpad is not a good macOS citizen.</p>

			 <p>Software engineering interviews are certainly something, aren‚Äôt they? A potential employer reviews your accomplishment, sees the code that you have contributed to open source projects on GitHub, and things seem to be going great. Then, the technical interview appears. It‚Äôs all down hill from here.</p>
<p>Does this sound familiar? I‚Äôm sure it does to many of you, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel bad about it. <em>The majority of technical interviews as they are given today are garbage.</em> There are some companies that do them well, but most of them do them bad. For this entry, I will be focusing on the companies that do them poorly, and describing why they are so terrible.</p>
<h3>The technical interview of today is often nothing more than a bastardized I.Q. test.</h3>
<p>Have you ever noticed that coding interview questions are often needlessly complicated and do not reflect anything that you would ever do on the job? Me too. If you have noticed this, it means you have actually worked in the field. Many of the questions are based around syntax-correctness, memorization of random API method signatures, and very specific algorithm implementation details. This is cute for trivia night, but it means nothing in the context of the job.</p>
<p><strong>A fun analogy:</strong> For my friends in the arts, let me give you an analogous example question that you might be asked if your technical interview were written by a hiring software engineer.</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou have a photoshop document with two layers. A base layer that is black, and a top layer that is white. A masking layer is added to the white layer and the white layer is set to 70% opacity. If you were to make a stroke with the brush tool on the masking layer with the color set to black at 50% opacity, what would the resulting color be in the hexadecimal format? It is OK if your answer is off by a few octets.‚Äù</p>
<p>If your first thought here was ‚Äúwho cares about this crap? I could figure it out in two seconds on the job with the color picker tool,‚Äù then your mind is in the right place. Indeed, <em>who cares</em>.</p>
<p>The majority of modern day technical interviews are nothing more than an I.Q. test for candidates under a different name. Which, by the way, was <a href="https://micro.blog/archives/546662">decided by the Supreme Court</a> to be scumbag behavior. They tell you nothing about an individuals ability to do the job well, but they do give you potential hints as to <a href="https://micro.blog/archives/546663">how wealthy that person may have been during their upbringing</a>.</p>
<p>Ever wonder why there are countless books on how to ‚Äúcrack the coding interview‚Äù and training businesses built around these draconian interviews? Now you know. It‚Äôs because they have nothing to do with the job. It is extracurricular work. It is an entirely different skillset.</p>
<p>I‚Äôll leave this one with a hot take, some exceptions apply:</p>
<p><em>‚ÄúThe engineer that spends their all of their time engineering is not qualified to pass an interview.‚Äù</em></p>
<h3>The technical interview does not pass empathy test, because it was not made for humans</h3>
<p><img src="uploads/2023/9c88850619.gif" alt="" width="600" height="247" /></p>
<p>There was an interesting study done by someone <a href="https://micro.blog/archives/546697">way smarter than me</a> that I think applies here. It is called the ‚ÄúIllusion of Transparency‚Äù which describes how humans tend to over-estimate how much of their own mental state is known by others. This happens in interviews <em>a lot</em> as it is, and it is even worse during the technical portion for engineers.</p>
<p>This concept, sometimes referred to as the ‚Äúcurse of knowledge‚Äù, seeps deep into the minds of interviewers everywhere. The interviewer that walks into a technical interview with all of the answers cannot ‚Äúun-know‚Äù what they are about to present to you as a test. Their frame of reference is warped, and more often than not, technical interviewers have no desire to be empathetic to those who they are interviewing. To the interviewer it is simple and easy, because they already know the answer going in. The interviewer has the curse of knowledge. This bias can lead an interviewer to see you as a poor candidate despite the test being inhospitable to how humans <em>actually</em> think.</p>
<p>So why design an interview like this if it sucks so bad? Why ignore all of these biases? Well, it comes down to good ol‚Äô corporate number crunching. These questions are hospitable to corporate timetables, as the fruits of the test can easily be placed into black-and-white boxes for quick assessment. Frankly, in these situations, the individual giving the interview does not have to care. They know the hyper-specific answers. If you also know these answers, you‚Äôre in. If you don‚Äôt, you‚Äôre out. Indeed, interviews like these are designed to benefit <em>corporate schedules</em> at the expense of <em>merit.</em> Remember this at all times.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that if you were to put a technical interviewer through their own interview process with a different question set of a similar design, there is an exceedingly good chance that they would stumble just as quickly as anyone else. And yes, this would happen to senior engineers, and even high level architects. The best of minds cannot compensate for the worst of tests.</p>
<p>If during a technical interview you stumble when being asked to point out some simplistic syntax error, or you forget some random API signature, don‚Äôt beat yourself up about it. Do not define yourself by a bad test. Keep your head high and keep searching.</p>
