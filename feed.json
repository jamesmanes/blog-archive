				"content_html": "<p>Well folks, this is a wild one. I recently wrote about a <a href=\"https://jmanes.blog/2023/12/30/roccat-kone-air.html\">Roccat Kone Air</a> mouse that I purchased for use exclusively with macOS. For a short while it worked great, but then the plan quickly fell apart.</p>\n<h2>Where are my profiles?</h2>\n<p>In my original blog post, I wrote about how the on-board profiles for the mouse had to be configured using Windows software; specifically, Roccat‚Äôs Swarm software. However, since the profiles are on-board, that implies that they are portable to different operating systems. To configure my mouse, I opened Roccat Swarm on a Parallels virtual machine of Windows 11 and began tweaking. After closing the virtual machine, all of my custom profiles worked on macOS as I expected‚Ä¶ that is, until I unplugged the 2.4Ghz USB receiver.</p>\n<p><img title=\"UntitledImage.png\" src=\"https://j.manes.blog/uploads/2024/untitledimage.png\" alt=\"A screenshot of the Roccat Swarm software running on my Windows 11 virtual machine through Parallels. The various custom profiles and button mappings are visible.\" width=\"599\" height=\"461\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>It turns out, the USB receiver needs a special sauce that only the Roccat Swarm software can provide. Re-launching Roccat Swarm from the Windows 11 virtual machine and then closing the virtual machine fixes the issue, but this solution sucks. I don‚Äôt want to do this every time I dock my Mac. Even worse, I use this same dock for my separate work-provisioned Mac. This means the profiles and their custom button mappings simply are not useful for my work environment. At this point I considered giving up and switching to a different mouse. However‚Ä¶ I am not sane, and I <em>really</em> like this mouse.</p>\n<h2>How does Roccat Swarm do it?</h2>\n<p>I got to thinking about how this whole thing works. I plug in the USB receiver‚Ä¶ I launch Roccat Swarm‚Ä¶ and it works. Even between operating systems (as long as the receiver is never unplugged), as proven by my Windows 11 virtual machine workflow. So maybe Roccat Swarm isn‚Äôt actually required. Maybe‚Ä¶ Roccat Swarm sends some type of system call, wake up packet, etc to the USB receiver. On this hunch I started digging.</p>\n<h2>Wireshark magic</h2>\n<p>I hang out in a Discord with a few ethical hacker type folks and when I brought this problem up, one of them recommended I use Wireshark to capture and dump the USB HID calls made by Roccat Swarm. This sounded like a good starting point. I had no idea Wireshark could even be used for USB devices, but I was willing to try anything. As a bonus, listening in on these calls is a clean-house reverse engineering approach to the problem.</p>\n<p>After a bit of research I fired up Wireshark on an old dedicated Windows machine using the <a href=\"https://desowin.org/usbpcap/\">USBPcap</a> plugin. I then attached the USB 2.4Ghz receiver to the Windows machine and opened Roccat Swarm. Wouldn‚Äôt you know it, it worked like a charm!</p>\n<p><img title=\"UntitledImage.png\" src=\"https://j.manes.blog/uploads/2024/3867d9537a.png\" alt=\"A screenshot of Wireshark showing a partial capture of USB calls as made by Roccat Swarm\" width=\"599\" height=\"506\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>Ok‚Ä¶ so there is a lot here. I don‚Äôt know the first thing about USB HID specifications or how it fits together (or at least, I didn‚Äôt when I started). I did notice however a distinct set of calls for ‚ÄúSET_REPORT‚Äù, each call with a respective data payload. So now I know what Roccat Swarm is sending to the device on startup, and I have the exact data it sends over. Awesome.</p>\n<h2>Time to learn a new programming language‚Ä¶ yes really</h2>\n<p>I have never programmed for macOS or iOS before, but I knew I was going to have to start. After a few failed attempts to use libusb with Python (Apple has locked out this approach, that‚Äôs a rant for a different time), I decided to look into Objective-C and Swift‚Ä¶ but mostly Swift in order to preserve my sanity.</p>\n<p>After digging for only a few hours I found an awesome library called <a href=\"https://github.com/Arti3DPlayer/USBDeviceSwift/tree/master\">USBDeviceSwift</a> that abstracts away a lot of nitty gritty details of USB / HID interactions. I pulled this into my project using Swift‚Äôs package manager (wild times we live in) and started learning and implementing. This involved reading the USB dump from Wireshark and translating the required segments for SET_REPORT into Swift model objects in my project.</p>\n<h2>Success and Thoughts</h2>\n<p>After a few days of tinkering during my spare time I finally got what I was after. I now have a simple command line tool that invokes a list of SET_REPORT calls to the Roccat Kone Air USB receiver. Running this program successfully activates the on-board profiles and their respective button mappings on macOS.¬†</p>\n<p><img title=\"UntitledImage.png\" src=\"https://j.manes.blog/uploads/2024/737b480229.png\" alt=\"A screenshot of the Terminal application on macOS invoking my custom program.\" width=\"599\" height=\"415\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>Curiously, doing a single SET_REPORT for any of these inputs is enough to do the job‚Ä¶ so I am not sure what that is about. I simply chose to do them all, as that is what the Roccat Swarm software does. Honestly? Totally worth the effort. I‚Äôm not exactly sure why this is necessary‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôm not sure why Roccat engineered the device to require these calls for on-board profile activation, but at least I have it working.</p>\n<p>As an aside, I wanted to try implementing this with DriverKit, but Apple wanted me to pay $100/yr for the privilege.

I had been interested in it for a while now, but it was nothing more than a passing interest. However, after talking with a few of the sales reps, they gave me a deal I could not refuse. They offered me the MSRP sale price of my 2019 Civic Type R as trade in value. In other words, they offered me a trade in credit equal to what I paid for the car brand new in 2019. ü§Ø I took the deal and quickly got into a gorgeous ‚Äúplatinum white pearl‚Äù Type S.</p>\n<p>This is not a typical ‚Äúday in the life‚Äù type of event for me (clearly), but it<em> is</em> something I must write about. I‚Äôll miss my Civic Type R; that car did a lot for me. It was a purchase of passion that followed my renewed interest in the automotive field. This interest pulled me out of a sadness that had followed me for years prior. It‚Äôs hard to explain, and it sounds very silly and materialistic. It wasn‚Äôt the car itself that put me into a better place, thankfully I can take the credit for that. The Type R did, however, symbolicly represent that special moment in my life where I felt a new passion for the first time in years. It represents the bloom of my 20s, even if that bloom came quite late (27).¬†</p>\n<p><img title=\"\" src=\"https://j.manes.blog/uploads/2023/ae57471e60.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"\" height=\"\" border=\"0\" /><img title=\"IMG_20190906_193432_Original.jpeg\" src=\"https://j.manes.blog/uploads/2023/img-20190906-193432-original.jpeg\" alt=\"My 2019 Civic Type R parked in the parking lot of a Micro Center.

				"content_text": "<p>It was a special day today.</p>\n<p>I went into the Acura dealer to take a look at the Integra Type S. I had been interested in it for a while now, but it was nothing more than a passing interest. However, after talking with a few of the sales reps, they gave me a deal I could not refuse. They offered me the MSRP sale price of my 2019 Civic Type R as trade in value. In other words, they offered me a trade in credit equal to what I paid for the car brand new in 2019. ü§Ø I took the deal and quickly got into a gorgeous ‚Äúplatinum white pearl‚Äù Type S.</p>\n<p>This is not a typical ‚Äúday in the life‚Äù type of event for me (clearly), but it<em> is</em> something I must write about. I‚Äôll miss my Civic Type R; that car did a lot for me. It was a purchase of passion that followed my renewed interest in the automotive field. This interest pulled me out of a sadness that had followed me for years prior. It‚Äôs hard to explain, and it sounds very silly and materialistic. It wasn‚Äôt the car itself that put me into a better place, thankfully I can take the credit for that. The Type R did, however, symbolicly represent that special moment in my life where I felt a new passion for the first time in years. It represents the bloom of my 20s, even if that bloom came quite late (27).¬†</p>\n<p><img title=\"\" src=\"https://j.manes.blog/uploads/2023/ae57471e60.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"\" height=\"\" border=\"0\" /><img title=\"IMG_20190906_193432_Original.jpeg\" src=\"https://j.manes.blog/uploads/2023/img-20190906-193432-original.jpeg\" alt=\"My 2019 Civic Type R parked in the parking lot of a Micro Center.

				"content_html": "<p>For many years now, I have used Dyson products: two <em>Pure Hot+Cool HP04</em>, one <em>Pure Humidify+Cool PH01</em> and a few of their vacuums. When it comes to the vacuums, I couldn‚Äôt be happier with the performance and experience provided. As for the humidfier and heaters, though‚Ä¶ it is complicated.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_5476.png\" src=\"https://j.manes.blog/uploads/2023/img-5476.png\" alt=\"My nickle/black Dyson Pure Hot+Cool HP04 next to my office wall.\" width=\"450\" height=\"600\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>Originally, I purchased a pair of Pure Hot+Cool HP04 heaters for the winter time. I keep one in my bedroom and one in my office where my pet guinea pigs live. I made a quick assumption during my purchase that you ‚Äúget what you pay for.‚Äù Dyson‚Äôs products are attractive and expensive, so I figured they would offer the highest performance. As it turns out, in this case, it isn‚Äôt true.</p>\n<h2>These devices are noisey as hell.</h2>\n<p>My first and chief complaint about these devices: they all suffer from build quality defects that lead to noise pollution. I don‚Äôt use that term lightly. It is seriously unbearable at times, to the point that I *must* turn the device off for my own sanity. Typically, the issue happens at the lowest speeds. There is some sort of fan oscillation going on that leads to the highest pitch squeeling imagineable. This happens with three of my Dyson fans; this is no fluke. When the fan is set to run above level 4 (out of 10) the squeeling will subside. Still, not ideal. Nearly a deal breaker for the product as a whole, in fact.</p>\n<h2>These devices are not good for air filtration.</h2>\n<p>My second complaint is that the air filtration offered by these machines is horrifically poor. The CADR (clean air delivery rate) rating is laughably low, and cheaper products exist that do the job far better. In fact, strapping MERV 8 rated HVAC filter on to a box fan does a better job. No, I‚Äôm not kidding. Check out this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uZKBlwLEFs\">CBC News video</a> for details on that one.</p>\n<p>Not only is the filtration unbearably slow, the filters within the unit cost around $80 to replace as of writing (2023), and they only last about one year before the Dyson app warns about ordering a replacement. In contrast, BlueAir offers a 211+ auto model with a filter that lasts WAY longer with over 4x the CADR. The replacement filter for the BlueAir? It is only $50. As of the time of writing, the BlueAir machine costs a whopping $250 less than what I paid for my Dyson, and it costs less in filter replacements, too. All of this is why my dining room / kitchen area is proudly accompanied by a BlueAir 211+ Auto.</p>\n<h2>The humidfier takes a long time to humidify.</h2>\n<p>My final complaint (whew, as if I could be any more negative) is that the <em>Pure Humidify+Cool PH01</em> takes what feels like forever to humidfy a room of any size. I believe this problem is very much aligned with the CADR problem. These fans simply do not move a lot of air, and that is by design. They are very nice to use as a personal fan, as they are (supposed to be) quiet and focused.</p>\n<p>However, the <em>Pure Humidify+Cool PH01</em> has a benefit I haven‚Äôt seen in other humidifiers in that it actually cleans the water before it puts it out into the room. It does this with UV light, which rocks, because typical humidfiers you see on Amazon are utter garbage in this respect. Don‚Äôt believe me? Buy a random Amazon humidifier and let it run while it sits next to a smart air filter such as a Dyson or BlueAir. Your air filters will fight for their lives trying to pull the gunk out of the air. With the Dyson PH01, no problems, the air is clean.</p>\n<h2>Somehow, these devices are still better than the alternative.</h2>\n<p>Now here is where things get complicated. These machines all perform a very specific subset of features that you will not find elsewhere. After getting fed up with the compromises, I started looking for alternatives only to find myself at an impasse. I wanted the best possible result in each of the respective areas (do one thing and do it well).</p>\n<p>If I wanted the best possible air filtration system, I could get a BlueAir for my bedroom and for my office. However, these are not heaters. Because of this, I‚Äôd also need to buy a set of heaters, and as it turns out, really good space heaters cost really good money. For example, De‚ÄôLonghi offers a very nice oil-filled radiator style heater for around $170. Ouch! But wait‚Ä¶ the BlueAir filter is not a heater, and it is also not a fan. So now a pair of high-quality fans are required. At this point, I‚Äôm up to a total of six devices (three for each room) to replace the two Dyson machines that I have. That means three total electrical outlets instead of one, and three times the space (which I do not have). The total cost of these machines added together would be in the same ballpark range as a Dyson. Whoops! No money saving to be found here (this wasn‚Äôt the goal, but it would have been nice).</p>\n<p>All of what I have touched on so far doesn‚Äôt address the problem of finding a good humidifier that outputs clean air (good luck with that shit, I tried). The integrated IoT (internet-of-things) capability was also not accounted for in my quest for the best, though you likely won‚Äôt find anything that works together as seemlessly as Dyson.</p>\n<p>I guess this is essentially where Dyson has the market.

It has become a rather ubiquitous tool in recent years, which makes me wonder if it is going to result in yet another Twitter fiasco.</p>\n<p>Generally, I am ok with paying (and donating) for software services. They have to meet some level criteria for me to feel comfortable, though. For example, if the software and/or service is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Open Source / Open Platform</li>\n<ul>\n<li>Lemmy (and selective instances)</li>\n<li>Mastodon (and selective instances)</li>\n</ul>\n<li>Proprietary and/or Centralized, but operated in good faith, with a history and face</li>\n<ul>\n<li>Kagi</li>\n<li>MarsEdit</li>\n<li>Micro.blog</li>\n<li>Ivory</li>\n</ul>\n<li>Privacy respecting by design, with mixed open source / proprietary status</li>\n<ul>\n<li>1Password</li>\n<li>Proton Mail</li>\n<li>iCloud (select services with advanced security enabled)</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<p>Discord is a prime example of something that does not quite fit into any of these categories. Discord does not respect privacy. Discort is not Open Source. Discord is not decentralized. Instead, it is held up by a combination of paid users and investors. This is enough to chase me away. I‚Äôm waiting for the inevitable sale of the platform and its data to a big tech conglomerate. The other shoe has yet to drop. Let‚Äôs just hope it isn‚Äôt placed into the hands of another Elon Musk.¬†</p>\n",
