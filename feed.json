There are clear moral implications involved, and maybe more importantly to a business‚Äôs perspective, an entity that will ensure one is acting consistently.

Teams have some flexibility as to how they define their process, but it needs to be repeatable and essentially bulletproof. This is done entirley to hold the teams accountable for their actions. If a bad defect is shipped, there will be specific requirements written about the defect, and tests will be written specific to that defect flow to ensure it never happens again.

This process could take days depending on the complexity of the defect shipped. Multiple engineers, tests analysts and managers will be involved.

				"content_html": "<p>Well folks, this is a wild one. I recently wrote about a <a href=\"https://jmanes.blog/2023/12/30/roccat-kone-air.html\">Roccat Kone Air</a> mouse that I purchased for use exclusively with macOS. For a short while it worked great, but then the plan quickly fell apart.</p>\n<h2>Where are my profiles?</h2>\n<p>In my original blog post, I wrote about how the on-board profiles for the mouse had to be configured using Windows software; specifically, Roccat‚Äôs Swarm software. However, since the profiles are on-board, that implies that they are portable to different operating systems. To configure my mouse, I opened Roccat Swarm on a Parallels virtual machine of Windows 11 and began tweaking. After closing the virtual machine, all of my custom profiles worked on macOS as I expected‚Ä¶ that is, until I unplugged the 2.4Ghz USB receiver.</p>\n<p><img title=\"UntitledImage.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/3480/2024/untitledimage.png\" alt=\"A screenshot of the Roccat Swarm software running on my Windows 11 virtual machine through Parallels. The various custom profiles and button mappings are visible.\" width=\"599\" height=\"461\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>It turns out, the USB receiver needs a special sauce that only the Roccat Swarm software can provide. Re-launching Roccat Swarm from the Windows 11 virtual machine and then closing the virtual machine fixes the issue, but this solution sucks. I don‚Äôt want to do this every time I dock my Mac. Even worse, I use this same dock for my separate work-provisioned Mac. This means the profiles and their custom button mappings simply are not useful for my work environment. At this point I considered giving up and switching to a different mouse. However‚Ä¶ I am not sane, and I <em>really</em> like this mouse.</p>\n<h2>How does Roccat Swarm do it?</h2>\n<p>I got to thinking about how this whole thing works. I plug in the USB receiver‚Ä¶ I launch Roccat Swarm‚Ä¶ and it works. Even between operating systems (as long as the receiver is never unplugged), as proven by my Windows 11 virtual machine workflow. So maybe Roccat Swarm isn‚Äôt actually required. Maybe‚Ä¶ Roccat Swarm sends some type of system call, wake up packet, etc to the USB receiver. On this hunch I started digging.</p>\n<h2>Wireshark magic</h2>\n<p>I hang out in a Discord with a few ethical hacker type folks and when I brought this problem up, one of them recommended I use Wireshark to capture and dump the USB HID calls made by Roccat Swarm. This sounded like a good starting point. I had no idea Wireshark could even be used for USB devices, but I was willing to try anything. As a bonus, listening in on these calls is a clean-house reverse engineering approach to the problem.</p>\n<p>After a bit of research I fired up Wireshark on an old dedicated Windows machine using the <a href=\"https://desowin.org/usbpcap/\">USBPcap</a> plugin. I then attached the USB 2.4Ghz receiver to the Windows machine and opened Roccat Swarm. Wouldn‚Äôt you know it, it worked like a charm!</p>\n<p><img title=\"UntitledImage.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/3480/2024/3867d9537a.png\" alt=\"A screenshot of Wireshark showing a partial capture of USB calls as made by Roccat Swarm\" width=\"599\" height=\"506\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>Ok‚Ä¶ so there is a lot here. I don‚Äôt know the first thing about USB HID specifications or how it fits together (or at least, I didn‚Äôt when I started). I did notice however a distinct set of calls for ‚ÄúSET_REPORT‚Äù, each call with a respective data payload. So now I know what Roccat Swarm is sending to the device on startup, and I have the exact data it sends over. Awesome.</p>\n<h2>Time to learn a new programming language‚Ä¶ yes really</h2>\n<p>I have never programmed for macOS or iOS before, but I knew I was going to have to start. After a few failed attempts to use libusb with Python (Apple has locked out this approach, that‚Äôs a rant for a different time), I decided to look into Objective-C and Swift‚Ä¶ but mostly Swift in order to preserve my sanity.</p>\n<p>After digging for only a few hours I found an awesome library called <a href=\"https://github.com/Arti3DPlayer/USBDeviceSwift/tree/master\">USBDeviceSwift</a> that abstracts away a lot of nitty gritty details of USB / HID interactions. I pulled this into my project using Swift‚Äôs package manager (wild times we live in) and started learning and implementing. This involved reading the USB dump from Wireshark and translating the required segments for SET_REPORT into Swift model objects in my project.</p>\n<h2>Success and Thoughts</h2>\n<p>After a few days of tinkering during my spare time I finally got what I was after. I now have a simple command line tool that invokes a list of SET_REPORT calls to the Roccat Kone Air USB receiver. Running this program successfully activates the on-board profiles and their respective button mappings on macOS.¬†</p>\n<p><img title=\"UntitledImage.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/3480/2024/737b480229.png\" alt=\"A screenshot of the Terminal application on macOS invoking my custom program.\" width=\"599\" height=\"415\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>Curiously, doing a single SET_REPORT for any of these inputs is enough to do the job‚Ä¶ so I am not sure what that is about. I simply chose to do them all, as that is what the Roccat Swarm software does. Honestly? Totally worth the effort. I‚Äôm not exactly sure why this is necessary‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôm not sure why Roccat engineered the device to require these calls for on-board profile activation, but at least I have it working.</p>\n<p>As an aside, I wanted to try implementing this with DriverKit, but Apple wanted me to pay $100/yr for the privilege. I‚Äôll stick with my command line program and a login script.¬†</p>\n",

I plug in the USB receiver‚Ä¶ I launch Roccat Swarm‚Ä¶ and it works. Even between operating systems (as long as the receiver is never unplugged), as proven by my Windows 11 virtual machine workflow. So maybe Roccat Swarm isn‚Äôt actually required. Maybe‚Ä¶ Roccat Swarm sends some type of system call, wake up packet, etc to the USB receiver. On this hunch I started digging.</p>\n<h2>Wireshark magic</h2>\n<p>I hang out in a Discord with a few ethical hacker type folks and when I brought this problem up, one of them recommended I use Wireshark to capture and dump the USB HID calls made by Roccat Swarm. This sounded like a good starting point. I had no idea Wireshark could even be used for USB devices, but I was willing to try anything. As a bonus, listening in on these calls is a clean-house reverse engineering approach to the problem.</p>\n<p>After a bit of research I fired up Wireshark on an old dedicated Windows machine using the <a href=\"https://desowin.org/usbpcap/\">USBPcap</a> plugin. I then attached the USB 2.4Ghz receiver to the Windows machine and opened Roccat Swarm. Wouldn‚Äôt you know it, it worked like a charm!</p>\n<p><img title=\"UntitledImage.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/3480/2024/3867d9537a.png\" alt=\"A screenshot of Wireshark showing a partial capture of USB calls as made by Roccat Swarm\" width=\"599\" height=\"506\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>Ok‚Ä¶ so there is a lot here. I don‚Äôt know the first thing about USB HID specifications or how it fits together (or at least, I didn‚Äôt when I started). I did notice however a distinct set of calls for ‚ÄúSET_REPORT‚Äù, each call with a respective data payload. So now I know what Roccat Swarm is sending to the device on startup, and I have the exact data it sends over. Awesome.</p>\n<h2>Time to learn a new programming language‚Ä¶ yes really</h2>\n<p>I have never programmed for macOS or iOS before, but I knew I was going to have to start. After a few failed attempts to use libusb with Python (Apple has locked out this approach, that‚Äôs a rant for a different time), I decided to look into Objective-C and Swift‚Ä¶ but mostly Swift in order to preserve my sanity.</p>\n<p>After digging for only a few hours I found an awesome library called <a href=\"https://github.com/Arti3DPlayer/USBDeviceSwift/tree/master\">USBDeviceSwift</a> that abstracts away a lot of nitty gritty details of USB / HID interactions. I pulled this into my project using Swift‚Äôs package manager (wild times we live in) and started learning and implementing. This involved reading the USB dump from Wireshark and translating the required segments for SET_REPORT into Swift model objects in my project.</p>\n<h2>Success and Thoughts</h2>\n<p>After a few days of tinkering during my spare time I finally got what I was after. I now have a simple command line tool that invokes a list of SET_REPORT calls to the Roccat Kone Air USB receiver. Running this program successfully activates the on-board profiles and their respective button mappings on macOS.¬†</p>\n<p><img title=\"UntitledImage.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/3480/2024/737b480229.png\" alt=\"A screenshot of the Terminal application on macOS invoking my custom program.\" width=\"599\" height=\"415\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>Curiously, doing a single SET_REPORT for any of these inputs is enough to do the job‚Ä¶ so I am not sure what that is about. I simply chose to do them all, as that is what the Roccat Swarm software does. Honestly? Totally worth the effort. I‚Äôm not exactly sure why this is necessary‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôm not sure why Roccat engineered the device to require these calls for on-board profile activation, but at least I have it working.</p>\n<p>As an aside, I wanted to try implementing this with DriverKit, but Apple wanted me to pay $100/yr for the privilege. I‚Äôll stick with my command line program and a login script.¬†</p>\n",

				"title": "Where Dyson Fans Work",
				"content_html": "<p>For many years now, I have used Dyson products: two <em>Pure Hot+Cool HP04</em>, one <em>Pure Humidify+Cool PH01</em> and a few of their vacuums. When it comes to the vacuums, I couldn‚Äôt be happier with the performance and experience provided. As for the humidfier and heaters, though‚Ä¶ it is complicated.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_5476.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/3480/2023/img-5476.png\" alt=\"My nickle/black Dyson Pure Hot+Cool HP04 next to my office wall.\" width=\"450\" height=\"600\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>Originally, I purchased a pair of Pure Hot+Cool HP04 heaters for the winter time. I keep one in my bedroom and one in my office where my pet guinea pigs live. I made a quick assumption during my purchase that you ‚Äúget what you pay for.‚Äù Dyson‚Äôs products are attractive and expensive, so I figured they would offer the highest performance. As it turns out, in this case, it isn‚Äôt true.</p>\n<h2>These devices are noisey as hell.</h2>\n<p>My first and chief complaint about these devices: they all suffer from build quality defects that lead to noise pollution. I don‚Äôt use that term lightly. It is seriously unbearable at times, to the point that I *must* turn the device off for my own sanity. Typically, the issue happens at the lowest speeds. There is some sort of fan oscillation going on that leads to the highest pitch squeeling imagineable. This happens with three of my Dyson fans; this is no fluke. When the fan is set to run above level 4 (out of 10) the squeeling will subside. Still, not ideal.

No, I‚Äôm not kidding.

As of the time of writing, the BlueAir machine costs a whopping $250 less than what I paid for my Dyson, and it costs less in filter replacements, too.

It does this with UV light, which rocks, because typical humidfiers you see on Amazon are utter garbage in this respect. Don‚Äôt believe me? Buy a random Amazon humidifier and let it run while it sits next to a smart air filter such as a Dyson or BlueAir. Your air filters will fight for their lives trying to pull the gunk out of the air.

However, these are not heaters. Because of this, I‚Äôd also need to buy a set of heaters, and as it turns out, really good space heaters cost really good money. For example, De‚ÄôLonghi offers a very nice oil-filled radiator style heater for around $170. Ouch! But wait‚Ä¶ the BlueAir filter is not a heater, and it is also not a fan. So now a pair of high-quality fans are required. At this point, I‚Äôm up to a total of six devices (three for each room) to replace the two Dyson machines that I have. That means three total electrical outlets instead of one, and three times the space (which I do not have).

I keep one in my bedroom and one in my office where my pet guinea pigs live. I made a quick assumption during my purchase that you ‚Äúget what you pay for.‚Äù Dyson‚Äôs products are attractive and expensive, so I figured they would offer the highest performance. As it turns out, in this case, it isn‚Äôt true.</p>\n<h2>These devices are noisey as hell.</h2>\n<p>My first and chief complaint about these devices: they all suffer from build quality defects that lead to noise pollution. I don‚Äôt use that term lightly. It is seriously unbearable at times, to the point that I *must* turn the device off for my own sanity. Typically, the issue happens at the lowest speeds. There is some sort of fan oscillation going on that leads to the highest pitch squeeling imagineable. This happens with three of my Dyson fans; this is no fluke. When the fan is set to run above level 4 (out of 10) the squeeling will subside. Still, not ideal. Nearly a deal breaker for the product as a whole, in fact.</p>\n<h2>These devices are not good for air filtration.</h2>\n<p>My second complaint is that the air filtration offered by these machines is horrifically poor.

				"content_html": "<p>Software engineering interviews are certainly something, aren‚Äôt they? A potential employer reviews your accomplishment, sees the code that you have contributed to open source projects on GitHub, and things seem to be going great. Then, the technical interview appears. It‚Äôs all down hill from here.</p>\n<p>Does this sound familiar? I‚Äôm sure it does to many of you, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel bad about it. <em>The majority of technical interviews as they are given today are garbage.</em> There are some companies that do them well, but most of them do them bad. For this entry, I will be focusing on the companies that do them poorly, and describing why they are so terrible.</p>\n<h3>The technical interview of today is often nothing more than a bastardized I.Q. test.</h3>\n<p>Have you ever noticed that coding interview questions are often needlessly complicated and do not reflect anything that you would ever do on the job? Me too. If you have noticed this, it means you have actually worked in the field. Many of the questions are based around syntax-correctness, memorization of random API method signatures, and very specific algorithm implementation details. This is cute for trivia night, but it means nothing in the context of the job.</p>\n<p><strong>A fun analogy:</strong> For my friends in the arts, let me give you an analogous example question that you might be asked if your technical interview were written by a hiring software engineer.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúYou have a photoshop document with two layers. A base layer that is black, and a top layer that is white. A masking layer is added to the white layer and the white layer is set to 70% opacity. If you were to make a stroke with the brush tool on the masking layer with the color set to black at 50% opacity, what would the resulting color be in the hexadecimal format? It is OK if your answer is off by a few octets.‚Äù</p>\n<p>If your first thought here was ‚Äúwho cares about this crap? I could figure it out in two seconds on the job with the color picker tool,‚Äù then your mind is in the right place. Indeed, <em>who cares</em>.</p>\n<p>The majority of modern day technical interviews are nothing more than an I.Q. test for candidates under a different name. Which, by the way, was <a href=\"https://micro.blog/archives/546662\">decided by the Supreme Court</a> to be scumbag behavior. They tell you nothing about an individuals ability to do the job well, but they do give you potential hints as to <a href=\"https://micro.blog/archives/546663\">how wealthy that person may have been during their upbringing</a>.</p>\n<p>Ever wonder why there are countless books on how to ‚Äúcrack the coding interview‚Äù and training businesses built around these draconian interviews? Now you know. It‚Äôs because they have nothing to do with the job. It is extracurricular work. It is an entirely different skillset.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôll leave this one with a hot take, some exceptions apply:</p>\n<p><em>‚ÄúThe engineer that spends their all of their time engineering is not qualified to pass an interview.‚Äù</em></p>\n<h3>The technical interview does not pass empathy test, because it was not made for humans</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/3480/2023/9c88850619.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"247\" /></p>\n<p>There was an interesting study done by someone <a href=\"https://micro.blog/archives/546697\">way smarter than me</a> that I think applies here. It is called the ‚ÄúIllusion of Transparency‚Äù which describes how humans tend to over-estimate how much of their own mental state is known by others. This happens in interviews <em>a lot</em> as it is, and it is even worse during the technical portion for engineers.</p>\n<p>This concept, sometimes referred to as the ‚Äúcurse of knowledge‚Äù, seeps deep into the minds of interviewers everywhere. The interviewer that walks into a technical interview with all of the answers cannot ‚Äúun-know‚Äù what they are about to present to you as a test. Their frame of reference is warped, and more often than not, technical interviewers have no desire to be empathetic to those who they are interviewing. To the interviewer it is simple and easy, because they already know the answer going in. The interviewer has the curse of knowledge. This bias can lead an interviewer to see you as a poor candidate despite the test being inhospitable to how humans <em>actually</em> think.</p>\n<p>So why design an interview like this if it sucks so bad? Why ignore all of these biases? Well, it comes down to good ol‚Äô corporate number crunching. These questions are hospitable to corporate timetables, as the fruits of the test can easily be placed into black-and-white boxes for quick assessment. Frankly, in these situations, the individual giving the interview does not have to care. They know the hyper-specific answers. If you also know these answers, you‚Äôre in. If you don‚Äôt, you‚Äôre out. Indeed, interviews like these are designed to benefit <em>corporate schedules</em> at the expense of <em>merit.</em> Remember this at all times.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that if you were to put a technical interviewer through their own interview process with a different question set of a similar design, there is an exceedingly good chance that they would stumble just as quickly as anyone else. And yes, this would happen to senior engineers, and even high level architects. The best of minds cannot compensate for the worst of tests.</p>\n<p>If during a technical interview you stumble when being asked to point out some simplistic syntax error, or you forget some random API signature, don‚Äôt beat yourself up about it. Do not define yourself by a bad test. Keep your head high and keep searching.</p>\n",

For this entry, I will be focusing on the companies that do them poorly, and describing why they are so terrible.</p>\n<h3>The technical interview of today is often nothing more than a bastardized I.Q. test.</h3>\n<p>Have you ever noticed that coding interview questions are often needlessly complicated and do not reflect anything that you would ever do on the job? Me too. If you have noticed this, it means you have actually worked in the field. Many of the questions are based around syntax-correctness, memorization of random API method signatures, and very specific algorithm implementation details. This is cute for trivia night, but it means nothing in the context of the job.</p>\n<p><strong>A fun analogy:</strong> For my friends in the arts, let me give you an analogous example question that you might be asked if your technical interview were written by a hiring software engineer.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúYou have a photoshop document with two layers. A base layer that is black, and a top layer that is white. A masking layer is added to the white layer and the white layer is set to 70% opacity. If you were to make a stroke with the brush tool on the masking layer with the color set to black at 50% opacity, what would the resulting color be in the hexadecimal format? It is OK if your answer is off by a few octets.‚Äù</p>\n<p>If your first thought here was ‚Äúwho cares about this crap? I could figure it out in two seconds on the job with the color picker tool,‚Äù then your mind is in the right place. Indeed, <em>who cares</em>.</p>\n<p>The majority of modern day technical interviews are nothing more than an I.Q. test for candidates under a different name. Which, by the way, was <a href=\"https://micro.blog/archives/546662\">decided by the Supreme Court</a> to be scumbag behavior. They tell you nothing about an individuals ability to do the job well, but they do give you potential hints as to <a href=\"https://micro.blog/archives/546663\">how wealthy that person may have been during their upbringing</a>.</p>\n<p>Ever wonder why there are countless books on how to ‚Äúcrack the coding interview‚Äù and training businesses built around these draconian interviews? Now you know. It‚Äôs because they have nothing to do with the job. It is extracurricular work. It is an entirely different skillset.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôll leave this one with a hot take, some exceptions apply:</p>\n<p><em>‚ÄúThe engineer that spends their all of their time engineering is not qualified to pass an interview.‚Äù</em></p>\n<h3>The technical interview does not pass empathy test, because it was not made for humans</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/3480/2023/9c88850619.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"247\" /></p>\n<p>There was an interesting study done by someone <a href=\"https://micro.blog/archives/546697\">way smarter than me</a> that I think applies here. It is called the ‚ÄúIllusion of Transparency‚Äù which describes how humans tend to over-estimate how much of their own mental state is known by others. This happens in interviews <em>a lot</em> as it is, and it is even worse during the technical portion for engineers.</p>\n<p>This concept, sometimes referred to as the ‚Äúcurse of knowledge‚Äù, seeps deep into the minds of interviewers everywhere. The interviewer that walks into a technical interview with all of the answers cannot ‚Äúun-know‚Äù what they are about to present to you as a test. Their frame of reference is warped, and more often than not, technical interviewers have no desire to be empathetic to those who they are interviewing. To the interviewer it is simple and easy, because they already know the answer going in. The interviewer has the curse of knowledge. This bias can lead an interviewer to see you as a poor candidate despite the test being inhospitable to how humans <em>actually</em> think.</p>\n<p>So why design an interview like this if it sucks so bad? Why ignore all of these biases? Well, it comes down to good ol‚Äô corporate number crunching. These questions are hospitable to corporate timetables, as the fruits of the test can easily be placed into black-and-white boxes for quick assessment. Frankly, in these situations, the individual giving the interview does not have to care. They know the hyper-specific answers. If you also know these answers, you‚Äôre in. If you don‚Äôt, you‚Äôre out. Indeed, interviews like these are designed to benefit <em>corporate schedules</em> at the expense of <em>merit.</em> Remember this at all times.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that if you were to put a technical interviewer through their own interview process with a different question set of a similar design, there is an exceedingly good chance that they would stumble just as quickly as anyone else. And yes, this would happen to senior engineers, and even high level architects. The best of minds cannot compensate for the worst of tests.</p>\n<p>If during a technical interview you stumble when being asked to point out some simplistic syntax error, or you forget some random API signature, don‚Äôt beat yourself up about it. Do not define yourself by a bad test. Keep your head high and keep searching.</p>\n",
