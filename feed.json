				"title": "Proton Mail: Reviews and Comparisons",
				"content_html": "<p>Up until recently, I had been using <a href=\"https://proton.me\">Proton</a> Mail (and Proton&rsquo;s other products) for all of my needs. They have a flashy suite of applications and services that tightly integrate while preserving user privacy. For example, Proton offers a password manager called Proton Pass which can create email aliases on-the-fly from <a href=\"https://simplelogin.io\">SimpleLogin</a>, a company which they acquired a few years back. Even more recently, they have &ldquo;teamed up with&rdquo; (purchased?) <a href=\"https://standardnotes.com\">Standard Notes</a> to offer an e2ee notes service. All of what Proton does is impressive. Their applications are pretty slick and they have been progressing rapidly recent years.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-cost\">The Cost</h2>\n<p>During my use of Proton&rsquo;s products, I would pay bi-yearly. This costs around $190 for 24 months of service, which is actually a highly competitive price for what you get. It is a mail service, calendar service, password manager, cloud storage provider, and VPN. If you were to break all of these out into separate services, it would cost more money for the same concepts. Here is how that stacks up to what I currently use:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Service</th>\n<th>Yearly Cost</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Proton</td>\n<td>$95</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</td>\n<td>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Fastmail</td>\n<td>$50</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1Password</td>\n<td>$35</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mullvad VPN</td>\n<td>$65</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>iCloud Drive</td>\n<td>$120</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Proton here is listed as $95/yr, which is simply the two-year price divided by 2. The rest of the services are shown at their yearly price rates. As you can see, Proton is less than half the overall cost of the other services combined. In fact, it is closer to three times less.</p>\n<p>One caveat about the drive storage, though. Proton Drive under their &ldquo;Proton Unlimited&rdquo; plan only comes with 500 gigabytes of storage, whereas iCloud comes with two terabytes. For me, this comparison still works, because I need more than 200 gigs (iClouds next-cheapest plan), but I would be comfortable with 500. Notice that if you were to remove iCloud Drive from this picture entirely, Proton would still be cheaper.</p>\n<h2 id=\"feature-comparison\">Feature Comparison</h2>\n<p>Time to compare Proton&rsquo;s individual services with the ones listed in the table above. I&rsquo;ll do my best.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mail-calendar-and-contacts\">Mail, Calendar, and Contacts</h3>\n<p>Proton Mail, Calendar, and Contacts are end-to-end encrypted. This is its chief advantage over competitors such as Fastmail. Note that this does <em>not</em> mean it is e2ee between email senders (this would break how email works and doesn&rsquo;t make sense), but rather it means that Proton cannot read the contents of your messages. This comes with some downsides, though, such as the <em>lack of interoperability</em>. Indeed, Proton is largely a siloed ecosystem by-design. If you want to use their services, you&rsquo;ll be using either their <a href=\"https://proton.me/blog/proton-mail-desktop-app\">desktop applications</a> or a web browser. There is no other way around this.</p>\n<h4 id=\"proton-mail-vs-fastmail\">Proton Mail v.s. Fastmail</h4>\n<p>Proton Mail specifically is a joy to use. Their integration with SimpleLogin (now folded into Proton Pass) is top-shelf. The desktop app works fine, and they even offer a <a href=\"https://proton.me/mail/bridge\">bridge</a> helper application so that you can use the email client of your choice (desktop only). I really wish they would expand the bridge to offer calendar and contacts, but Proton seems more inclined to reject interoperability for their own applications.</p>\n<p>Fastmail, likewise, is a joy to use. They have a good mobile app which is <em>basically</em> required if you want to send emails using their baked-in email aliasing service (you can do it without their app, but it is a horrible experience). Unlike Proton Mail, you can also forgo using their app entirely and add your Fastmail account to iOS in settings. I do this on my iPhone and the built-in Apple Mail app works great with Fastmail.</p>\n<p>Both services offer email aliasing. Proton leverages SimpleLogin which is far more flexible and powerful than the baked-in aliasing Fastmail uses, though both approaches get the job done. I have to give the edge to Proton on email aliasing, though, as I do find myself missing SimpleLogin and its near-endless flexibility.</p>\n<p>For example, Proton&rsquo;s approach to aliasing offers the dynamic generation of aliases with a catch-all. In this workflow, while signing up for a new site, you could type in something like &ldquo;<a href=\"mailto:newsite@mydomain.email\">newsite@mydomain.email</a>&rdquo; into the email form on the sign-up page and create your account. Once the site sends an email and it hits SimpleLogin, it will dynamically create a <a href=\"mailto:newsite@mydomain.email\">newsite@mydomain.email</a> alias for you and land the contents in your inbox. No need to fumble around with an app to create an email alias beforehand. This workflow is unparalleled, and I miss it dearly.</p>\n<p>It should also be noted that in Fastmail, their aliasing for &ldquo;masked emails&rdquo; (this is what they call it) is limited to a single domain name (yes, really), and you do not get to choose the name of these aliased email addresses. If you want something like <a href=\"mailto:target@mydomain.email\">target@mydomain.email</a>, too bad. Fastmail will give you some crappy auto-generated name like <a href=\"mailto:soft.tree1923@mydomain.email\">soft.tree1923@mydomain.email</a> and you just have to deal with it. There are ways around this using their manual email address feature, which inconveniently does not get leveraged by 3rd parties looking to integrate, but that is too much info to put here. Just know that it is not ideal, I&rsquo;d give it a B-.</p>\n<h4 id=\"proton-calendar-vs-fastmail\">Proton Calendar v.s. Fastmail</h4>\n<p>Proton Calendar is not good. The calendar service is bare-bones with almost no features and it does not yet offer an <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ProtonMail/comments/11zfag4/proton_calendar_app_for_ipad\">iPad app</a>. Due to the lack of interoperability, you&rsquo;ll be stuck using their standalone Proton Calendar iOS app or a web browser. Proton calendar exists, that is about the only good thing I can say about it.</p>\n<p>Fastmail&rsquo;s calendar is great. It does everything you&rsquo;d expect from a modern calendar service and fully interops with the calendar client of your choice on both mobile and desktop. It also allows you to manage any Google calendars you might have right through Fastmail, which is great if you have family members in the Google ecosystem with shared calendars. I can make changes in my Apple Calendar application and have it update a Google calendar <em>through</em> Fastmail. I am never juggling multiple accounts on any of my devices. All is done through Fastmail thanks to integrations like these.</p>\n<h4 id=\"proton-contacts-vs-fastmail\">Proton Contacts v.s. Fastmail</h4>\n<p>There is no contacts application or integration for Proton. For those of us that actually use our contacts across multiple devices, this really sucks. Contacts in Proton exist as an afterthought, or maybe more generously, a means to an end that kinda-sorta exists only within the context of emailing people. According to their <a href=\"https://proton.me/support/proton-contacts-mobile\">support page</a> they are working to make contacts better, but for now it stinks.</p>\n<p>Fastmail&rsquo;s contacts are great. Again, it does everything you&rsquo;d expect, and you can use the client of your choice on both mobile and desktop.</p>\n<h3 id=\"password-manager-proton-pass-vs-1password\">Password Manager (Proton Pass v.s. 1Password)</h3>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s make this quick. In every way possible, 1Password wins. Proton Pass is decent, but as of writing, it does not support <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ProtonPass/comments/14m7u1i/comment/jq0e5y0/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button\">Safari</a> which is awful for Mac users. It also does not yet have desktop applications for macOS or Linux. Their website shows &ldquo;coming soon,&rdquo; but who knows how long that will take. Proton Pass does have baked in email alias generation through SimpleLogin, but 1Password <a href=\"https://www.fastmail.com/1password/\">supports email alias generation</a> with Fastmail; so there you go.</p>\n<h3 id=\"vpn-proton-vpn-vs-mullvad\">VPN (Proton VPN v.s. Mullvad)</h3>\n<p>Both offerings here are great. I have used both extensively, and I enjoy both. I will say Mullvad has far better support for Linux than Proton does, and Mullvad also supports IPv6, <a href=\"https://protonmail.uservoice.com/forums/932836-proton-vpn/suggestions/43849329-ipv6-support\">unlike Proton VPN</a>. Unless those two gaps are dealbreakers for you, Proton VPN is an equal match with Mullvad.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cloud-storage-proton-drive-vs-whatever\">Cloud Storage (Proton Drive v.s. whatever)</h3>\n<p>Proton drive is fine. The desktop app on macOS, last I tried it, was quite buggy, but worked pretty consistently after a few updates. For Apple inclined folks, iCloud drive is the better play. You can achieve e2ee in iCloud using <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/108756\">Advanced Data Protection</a>, so it is not like you are missing out on any ground-breaking concepts. iCloud storage space also comes with the benefit of supporting your iCloud photo library, which again, is e2ee with Advanced Data Protection turned on.</p>\n<h2 id=\"summary\">Summary</h2>\n<p>Well, there you have it. The overall cost of combining services is nearly 3x the price of Proton, but the experience that you get in return is overall better. I believe this is due to the so-called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy\">UNIX philosophy</a> of &ldquo;do one thing and do it well.&rdquo; It costs more to purchase individual services that are hyper-focused on what they do, but the user experience is certainly more rewarding.</p>\n",

Proton Pass is decent, but as of writing, it does not support [Safari](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProtonPass/comments/14m7u1i/comment/jq0e5y0/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) which is awful for Mac users. It also does not yet have desktop applications for macOS or Linux. Their website shows \"coming soon,\" but who knows how long that will take. Proton Pass does have baked in email alias generation through SimpleLogin, but 1Password [supports email alias generation](https://www.fastmail.com/1password/) with Fastmail; so there you go.\n\n### VPN (Proton VPN v.s. Mullvad)\n\nBoth offerings here are great. I have used both extensively, and I enjoy both. I will say Mullvad has far better support for Linux than Proton does, and Mullvad also supports IPv6, [unlike Proton VPN](https://protonmail.uservoice.com/forums/932836-proton-vpn/suggestions/43849329-ipv6-support). Unless those two gaps are dealbreakers for you, Proton VPN is an equal match with Mullvad.\n\n### Cloud Storage (Proton Drive v.s. whatever)\n\nProton drive is fine. The desktop app on macOS, last I tried it, was quite buggy, but worked pretty consistently after a few updates. For Apple inclined folks, iCloud drive is the better play. You can achieve e2ee in iCloud using [Advanced Data Protection](https://support.apple.com/en-us/108756), so it is not like you are missing out on any ground-breaking concepts. iCloud storage space also comes with the benefit of supporting your iCloud photo library, which again, is e2ee with Advanced Data Protection turned on.\n\n## Summary\n\nWell, there you have it. The overall cost of combining services is nearly 3x the price of Proton, but the experience that you get in return is overall better. I believe this is due to the so-called [UNIX philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy) of \"do one thing and do it well.\" It costs more to purchase individual services that are hyper-focused on what they do, but the user experience is certainly more rewarding.\n",

I recently wrote about a <a href=\"https://jmanes.blog/2023/12/30/roccat-kone-air.html\">Roccat Kone Air</a> mouse that I purchased for use exclusively with macOS. For a short while it worked great, but then the plan quickly fell apart.</p>\n<h2>Where are my profiles?</h2>\n<p>In my original blog post, I wrote about how the on-board profiles for the mouse had to be configured using Windows software; specifically, Roccat’s Swarm software. However, since the profiles are on-board, that implies that they are portable to different operating systems. To configure my mouse, I opened Roccat Swarm on a Parallels virtual machine of Windows 11 and began tweaking. After closing the virtual machine, all of my custom profiles worked on macOS as I expected… that is, until I unplugged the 2.4Ghz USB receiver.</p>\n<p><img title=\"UntitledImage.png\" src=\"https://james.manes.blog/uploads/2024/untitledimage.png\" alt=\"A screenshot of the Roccat Swarm software running on my Windows 11 virtual machine through Parallels. The various custom profiles and button mappings are visible.\" width=\"599\" height=\"461\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>It turns out, the USB receiver needs a special sauce that only the Roccat Swarm software can provide. Re-launching Roccat Swarm from the Windows 11 virtual machine and then closing the virtual machine fixes the issue, but this solution sucks. I don’t want to do this every time I dock my Mac. Even worse, I use this same dock for my separate work-provisioned Mac. This means the profiles and their custom button mappings simply are not useful for my work environment. At this point I considered giving up and switching to a different mouse. However… I am not sane, and I <em>really</em> like this mouse.</p>\n<h2>How does Roccat Swarm do it?</h2>\n<p>I got to thinking about how this whole thing works. I plug in the USB receiver… I launch Roccat Swarm… and it works. Even between operating systems (as long as the receiver is never unplugged), as proven by my Windows 11 virtual machine workflow. So maybe Roccat Swarm isn’t actually required. Maybe… Roccat Swarm sends some type of system call, wake up packet, etc to the USB receiver. On this hunch I started digging.</p>\n<h2>Wireshark magic</h2>\n<p>I hang out in a Discord with a few ethical hacker type folks and when I brought this problem up, one of them recommended I use Wireshark to capture and dump the USB HID calls made by Roccat Swarm. This sounded like a good starting point. I had no idea Wireshark could even be used for USB devices, but I was willing to try anything. As a bonus, listening in on these calls is a clean-house reverse engineering approach to the problem.</p>\n<p>After a bit of research I fired up Wireshark on an old dedicated Windows machine using the <a href=\"https://desowin.org/usbpcap/\">USBPcap</a> plugin. I then attached the USB 2.4Ghz receiver to the Windows machine and opened Roccat Swarm. Wouldn’t you know it, it worked like a charm!</p>\n<p><img title=\"UntitledImage.png\" src=\"https://james.manes.blog/uploads/2024/3867d9537a.png\" alt=\"A screenshot of Wireshark showing a partial capture of USB calls as made by Roccat Swarm\" width=\"599\" height=\"506\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>Ok… so there is a lot here. I don’t know the first thing about USB HID specifications or how it fits together (or at least, I didn’t when I started). I did notice however a distinct set of calls for “SET_REPORT”, each call with a respective data payload. So now I know what Roccat Swarm is sending to the device on startup, and I have the exact data it sends over. Awesome.</p>\n<h2>Time to learn a new programming language… yes really</h2>\n<p>I have never programmed for macOS or iOS before, but I knew I was going to have to start. After a few failed attempts to use libusb with Python (Apple has locked out this approach, that’s a rant for a different time), I decided to look into Objective-C and Swift… but mostly Swift in order to preserve my sanity.</p>\n<p>After digging for only a few hours I found an awesome library called <a href=\"https://github.com/Arti3DPlayer/USBDeviceSwift/tree/master\">USBDeviceSwift</a> that abstracts away a lot of nitty gritty details of USB / HID interactions. I pulled this into my project using Swift’s package manager (wild times we live in) and started learning and implementing. This involved reading the USB dump from Wireshark and translating the required segments for SET_REPORT into Swift model objects in my project.</p>\n<h2>Success and Thoughts</h2>\n<p>After a few days of tinkering during my spare time I finally got what I was after. I now have a simple command line tool that invokes a list of SET_REPORT calls to the Roccat Kone Air USB receiver. Running this program successfully activates the on-board profiles and their respective button mappings on macOS. </p>\n<p><img title=\"UntitledImage.png\" src=\"https://james.manes.blog/uploads/2024/737b480229.png\" alt=\"A screenshot of the Terminal application on macOS invoking my custom program.\" width=\"599\" height=\"415\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>Curiously, doing a single SET_REPORT for any of these inputs is enough to do the job… so I am not sure what that is about. I simply chose to do them all, as that is what the Roccat Swarm software does. Honestly? Totally worth the effort. I’m not exactly sure why this is necessary… and I’m not sure why Roccat engineered the device to require these calls for on-board profile activation, but at least I have it working.</p>\n<p>As an aside, I wanted to try implementing this with DriverKit, but Apple wanted me to pay $100/yr for the privilege. I’ll stick with my command line program and a login script. </p>\n",

This involved reading the USB dump from Wireshark and translating the required segments for SET_REPORT into Swift model objects in my project.</p>\n<h2>Success and Thoughts</h2>\n<p>After a few days of tinkering during my spare time I finally got what I was after. I now have a simple command line tool that invokes a list of SET_REPORT calls to the Roccat Kone Air USB receiver. Running this program successfully activates the on-board profiles and their respective button mappings on macOS. </p>\n<p><img title=\"UntitledImage.png\" src=\"https://james.manes.blog/uploads/2024/737b480229.png\" alt=\"A screenshot of the Terminal application on macOS invoking my custom program.\" width=\"599\" height=\"415\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>Curiously, doing a single SET_REPORT for any of these inputs is enough to do the job… so I am not sure what that is about. I simply chose to do them all, as that is what the Roccat Swarm software does. Honestly? Totally worth the effort. I’m not exactly sure why this is necessary… and I’m not sure why Roccat engineered the device to require these calls for on-board profile activation, but at least I have it working.</p>\n<p>As an aside, I wanted to try implementing this with DriverKit, but Apple wanted me to pay $100/yr for the privilege. I’ll stick with my command line program and a login script. </p>\n",

				"title": "Where Dyson Fans Work",
				"content_html": "<p>For many years now, I have used Dyson products: two <em>Pure Hot+Cool HP04</em>, one <em>Pure Humidify+Cool PH01</em> and a few of their vacuums. When it comes to the vacuums, I couldn’t be happier with the performance and experience provided. As for the humidfier and heaters, though… it is complicated.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_5476.png\" src=\"https://james.manes.blog/uploads/2023/img-5476.png\" alt=\"My nickle/black Dyson Pure Hot+Cool HP04 next to my office wall.\" width=\"450\" height=\"600\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>Originally, I purchased a pair of Pure Hot+Cool HP04 heaters for the winter time. I keep one in my bedroom and one in my office where my pet guinea pigs live. I made a quick assumption during my purchase that you “get what you pay for.” Dyson’s products are attractive and expensive, so I figured they would offer the highest performance. As it turns out, in this case, it isn’t true.</p>\n<h2>These devices are noisey as hell.</h2>\n<p>My first and chief complaint about these devices: they all suffer from build quality defects that lead to noise pollution. I don’t use that term lightly. It is seriously unbearable at times, to the point that I *must* turn the device off for my own sanity. Typically, the issue happens at the lowest speeds. There is some sort of fan oscillation going on that leads to the highest pitch squeeling imagineable. This happens with three of my Dyson fans; this is no fluke. When the fan is set to run above level 4 (out of 10) the squeeling will subside. Still, not ideal. Nearly a deal breaker for the product as a whole, in fact.</p>\n<h2>These devices are not good for air filtration.</h2>\n<p>My second complaint is that the air filtration offered by these machines is horrifically poor. The CADR (clean air delivery rate) rating is laughably low, and cheaper products exist that do the job far better. In fact, strapping MERV 8 rated HVAC filter on to a box fan does a better job. No, I’m not kidding. Check out this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uZKBlwLEFs\">CBC News video</a> for details on that one.</p>\n<p>Not only is the filtration unbearably slow, the filters within the unit cost around $80 to replace as of writing (2023), and they only last about one year before the Dyson app warns about ordering a replacement. In contrast, BlueAir offers a 211+ auto model with a filter that lasts WAY longer with over 4x the CADR. The replacement filter for the BlueAir? It is only $50. As of the time of writing, the BlueAir machine costs a whopping $250 less than what I paid for my Dyson, and it costs less in filter replacements, too. All of this is why my dining room / kitchen area is proudly accompanied by a BlueAir 211+ Auto.</p>\n<h2>The humidfier takes a long time to humidify.</h2>\n<p>My final complaint (whew, as if I could be any more negative) is that the <em>Pure Humidify+Cool PH01</em> takes what feels like forever to humidfy a room of any size. I believe this problem is very much aligned with the CADR problem. These fans simply do not move a lot of air, and that is by design. They are very nice to use as a personal fan, as they are (supposed to be) quiet and focused.</p>\n<p>However, the <em>Pure Humidify+Cool PH01</em> has a benefit I haven’t seen in other humidifiers in that it actually cleans the water before it puts it out into the room. It does this with UV light, which rocks, because typical humidfiers you see on Amazon are utter garbage in this respect. Don’t believe me? Buy a random Amazon humidifier and let it run while it sits next to a smart air filter such as a Dyson or BlueAir. Your air filters will fight for their lives trying to pull the gunk out of the air. With the Dyson PH01, no problems, the air is clean.</p>\n<h2>Somehow, these devices are still better than the alternative.</h2>\n<p>Now here is where things get complicated. These machines all perform a very specific subset of features that you will not find elsewhere. After getting fed up with the compromises, I started looking for alternatives only to find myself at an impasse. I wanted the best possible result in each of the respective areas (do one thing and do it well).</p>\n<p>If I wanted the best possible air filtration system, I could get a BlueAir for my bedroom and for my office. However, these are not heaters. Because of this, I’d also need to buy a set of heaters, and as it turns out, really good space heaters cost really good money. For example, De’Longhi offers a very nice oil-filled radiator style heater for around $170. Ouch! But wait… the BlueAir filter is not a heater, and it is also not a fan. So now a pair of high-quality fans are required. At this point, I’m up to a total of six devices (three for each room) to replace the two Dyson machines that I have. That means three total electrical outlets instead of one, and three times the space (which I do not have). The total cost of these machines added together would be in the same ballpark range as a Dyson. Whoops! No money saving to be found here (this wasn’t the goal, but it would have been nice).</p>\n<p>All of what I have touched on so far doesn’t address the problem of finding a good humidifier that outputs clean air (good luck with that shit, I tried). The integrated IoT (internet-of-things) capability was also not accounted for in my quest for the best, though you likely won’t find anything that works together as seemlessly as Dyson.</p>\n<p>I guess this is essentially where Dyson has the market. It’s a bit strange, but this is a case where the market leader is a jack of all trades, and master of none: It’s not the best fan, it’s not the best heater (or humidifier), and it’s not the best air filter… but it does all three of these things while using very little space, and for a competitive price.</p>\n<p>For now, I’ll be coughing up $80 for an air filter.</p>\n",

I keep one in my bedroom and one in my office where my pet guinea pigs live. I made a quick assumption during my purchase that you “get what you pay for.” Dyson’s products are attractive and expensive, so I figured they would offer the highest performance. As it turns out, in this case, it isn’t true.</p>\n<h2>These devices are noisey as hell.</h2>\n<p>My first and chief complaint about these devices: they all suffer from build quality defects that lead to noise pollution. I don’t use that term lightly. It is seriously unbearable at times, to the point that I *must* turn the device off for my own sanity. Typically, the issue happens at the lowest speeds. There is some sort of fan oscillation going on that leads to the highest pitch squeeling imagineable. This happens with three of my Dyson fans; this is no fluke. When the fan is set to run above level 4 (out of 10) the squeeling will subside. Still, not ideal. Nearly a deal breaker for the product as a whole, in fact.</p>\n<h2>These devices are not good for air filtration.</h2>\n<p>My second complaint is that the air filtration offered by these machines is horrifically poor. The CADR (clean air delivery rate) rating is laughably low, and cheaper products exist that do the job far better. In fact, strapping MERV 8 rated HVAC filter on to a box fan does a better job. No, I’m not kidding. Check out this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uZKBlwLEFs\">CBC News video</a> for details on that one.</p>\n<p>Not only is the filtration unbearably slow, the filters within the unit cost around $80 to replace as of writing (2023), and they only last about one year before the Dyson app warns about ordering a replacement. In contrast, BlueAir offers a 211+ auto model with a filter that lasts WAY longer with over 4x the CADR. The replacement filter for the BlueAir? It is only $50. As of the time of writing, the BlueAir machine costs a whopping $250 less than what I paid for my Dyson, and it costs less in filter replacements, too. All of this is why my dining room / kitchen area is proudly accompanied by a BlueAir 211+ Auto.</p>\n<h2>The humidfier takes a long time to humidify.</h2>\n<p>My final complaint (whew, as if I could be any more negative) is that the <em>Pure Humidify+Cool PH01</em> takes what feels like forever to humidfy a room of any size. I believe this problem is very much aligned with the CADR problem. These fans simply do not move a lot of air, and that is by design. They are very nice to use as a personal fan, as they are (supposed to be) quiet and focused.</p>\n<p>However, the <em>Pure Humidify+Cool PH01</em> has a benefit I haven’t seen in other humidifiers in that it actually cleans the water before it puts it out into the room. It does this with UV light, which rocks, because typical humidfiers you see on Amazon are utter garbage in this respect. Don’t believe me? Buy a random Amazon humidifier and let it run while it sits next to a smart air filter such as a Dyson or BlueAir. Your air filters will fight for their lives trying to pull the gunk out of the air. With the Dyson PH01, no problems, the air is clean.</p>\n<h2>Somehow, these devices are still better than the alternative.</h2>\n<p>Now here is where things get complicated. These machines all perform a very specific subset of features that you will not find elsewhere. After getting fed up with the compromises, I started looking for alternatives only to find myself at an impasse. I wanted the best possible result in each of the respective areas (do one thing and do it well).</p>\n<p>If I wanted the best possible air filtration system, I could get a BlueAir for my bedroom and for my office. However, these are not heaters. Because of this, I’d also need to buy a set of heaters, and as it turns out, really good space heaters cost really good money. For example, De’Longhi offers a very nice oil-filled radiator style heater for around $170. Ouch! But wait… the BlueAir filter is not a heater, and it is also not a fan. So now a pair of high-quality fans are required. At this point, I’m up to a total of six devices (three for each room) to replace the two Dyson machines that I have. That means three total electrical outlets instead of one, and three times the space (which I do not have). The total cost of these machines added together would be in the same ballpark range as a Dyson. Whoops! No money saving to be found here (this wasn’t the goal, but it would have been nice).</p>\n<p>All of what I have touched on so far doesn’t address the problem of finding a good humidifier that outputs clean air (good luck with that shit, I tried). The integrated IoT (internet-of-things) capability was also not accounted for in my quest for the best, though you likely won’t find anything that works together as seemlessly as Dyson.</p>\n<p>I guess this is essentially where Dyson has the market. It’s a bit strange, but this is a case where the market leader is a jack of all trades, and master of none: It’s not the best fan, it’s not the best heater (or humidifier), and it’s not the best air filter… but it does all three of these things while using very little space, and for a competitive price.</p>\n<p>For now, I’ll be coughing up $80 for an air filter.</p>\n",
